I am an applied economist specialized in public policy evaluation, labor markets, firm, and climate shocks. I work primarily with R and Stata for data analysis and econometric modeling.

My current research focuses on the changing nature of work and the impacts of climate shocks on labor markets in developing countries. I am particularly interested in how the demand for tasks and skills evolves over time, and how this transformation is shaped by structural factors such as education, technological change, and trade.

A second line of studies explores how climate variability and extreme weather events affect labor mobility and employment trajectories. I aim to understand how individuals and households adapt to environmental shocks, and how these responses vary across different socioeconomic contexts.\
